# weather_history
__Weather project for "Python: Data Analysis" LinkedIn cource__

The project is still in progress.

I would like to present some test work with NumPy and Matplotlib libraries - investigation of weather data using [Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) database  ](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/global-historical-climatology-network-ghcn) at U.S. NOAA Climate Data Online service.
I shoosed data from station UPM00033345 in Kyiv, Ukraine.


__One of the test outputs - summary of maximum and minimum temperature over main observable period, and comparison with my birthday year - 1980 :)__
